# 🐾 Paws & Preferences

A simple **cat swiping web app** built with **TypeScript, Sass, and Vite**.  
Users can swipe 🫱 (right) to **like** or 🫲 (left) to **dislike** cats, and view a summary of the cats they liked.

> 🚀 **Live Demo:** [Paws & Preferences on GitHub Pages](https://yinxin-l.github.io/paws-preferences/)
> 
> ⚠️ **Note:** Image loading speed may vary because the images are fetched directly from the Cataas API, which can sometimes take a moment to respond.
